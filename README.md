The repository has three major sections.
All the work done is based out of small projects.
The first repo consists of work done in C++ and contains several programs with titles of the program and also code related to it.
Second part contains JavaScript code based on my projects to erarn the certificates from FreeCodecamp.
Final Repo contains my work related to web design and creation using HTML and CSS.
